The cab file for your application has been built as 'C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Desktop\Timesheet\Install-pob\POB.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Desktop\Timesheet\Install-pob\Support\POB.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
